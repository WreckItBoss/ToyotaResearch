The purpose of this dataset is to utilize the provided climate simulation numerical data to analyze small-scale atmospheric processes such as clouds, storms, turbulence, and radiation, which have significant influences on large-scale climate patterns. The data is intended to aid in the training and development of machine learning models capable of emulating the outputs of cloud-resolving models, helping to deepen our understanding of climate science. The dataset provides various input variables including temperature, precipitation, and radiation to facilitate comprehensive analysis and model development.
