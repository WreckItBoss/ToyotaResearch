This dataset is primarily used for credit risk assessment by predictive modelling of client defaults. It combines various data sources, including application histories, tax registries, credit bureau records, and deposit information, to develop accurate and stable models across different test data ranges. Other uses include analyzing financial behavior patterns, evaluating creditworthiness, and providing insights into risk management in finance. The use of coded data transformations allows for detailed analysis of factors such as days past due or amount adjustments, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of credit risk.
