Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each column and what the data represents:\n\n1. **time**: This likely represents timestamps, though it is simplified here.\n   \n2. **use [kW]**: Total energy consumption in kilowatts (kW).\n   \n3. **gen [kW]**: Total energy generation by means of solar or other power generation resources in kilowatts (kW).\n   \n4. **House overall [kW]**: Overall house energy consumption in kilowatts (kW).\n\n5. **Dishwasher [kW]**: Energy consumed by the dishwasher in kilowatts (kW).\n\n6. **Furnace 1 [kW]**: Energy consumed by furnace 1 in kilowatts (kW).\n\n7. **Furnace 2 [kW]**: Energy consumed by furnace 2 in kilowatts (kW).\n\n8. **Home office [kW]**: Energy consumed by the home office in kilowatts (kW).\n\n9. **Fridge [kW]**: Energy consumed by the fridge in kilowatts (kW).\n\n10. **Wine cellar [kW]**: Energy consumed by the wine cellar in kilowatts (kW).\n\nEach row represents data recorded at a different time point. The values in the table show the measured data for each timestamp and each category (use, generation, specific appliance consumption, etc.). Along with the numeric data, there are also small histogram plots above each column, providing a visual distribution of the data in that column.', 'refusal': None}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 1457, 'completion_tokens': 346, 'total_tokens': 1803}, 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c9aa9c0491'}
